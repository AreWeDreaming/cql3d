Hi Bob,

Yes, with lbndry=fixed,
the peak of distr.func. is ~four orders of magnitude smaller
than in lbdry=conscale,
and the source is also ~four orders smaller.

With lbdry=fixed, the positive jump at v~0 is also present -
it is visible at time step 25, for example (in Cuts of f vs v). At later 
time steps n>110, this jump disappears in
lbdry=fixed run, but not in lbdry=consscal.

BTW, the runs with lbdry=conserv are similar to consscal,
so there is a positive jump at V~0, too.

I am not clear yet why this jump occurs.
I need to dig into it more.
Yes, I would expect the distribution to behave good at V=0
when lbdry=conserv.

Yuri
