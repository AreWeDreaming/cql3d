This is a purely f90 pointered version of cql3d, going forward.



Feb 2, 2011
===========
franklin: svn update, after commit of major revision from compx1.



Feb 3, 2011
===========
Major revision for MPI committed from compx1.

See  ./README_cql3d_devel



NOTE:  Some variables in cqlinput_help refer to the finite orbit
version of the code, which is still being developed and is not
yet released (BH20151031).


To get an idea of most recent make files, do 
ls -lt make*
160602
======
c[263] version="cql3d_fullFOW_160508.2"
c[263] Upgraded lossmode(1)='simplban' so banana (+gyro) losses are based
c[263] on the first order deltarho orbit shift.  Kept the old pre-160403
c[263] model (='simplbn2'), and an intermediate model (='simplbn1') for
c[263] backward compatibility and cross-checking.  Main changes are in 
c[262] losscome.f.  [See file log.1_simplban_extended.gz for comparisons.]
c[262] Should use lossmode(1)='simplban' in combination with ndeltarho=
c[262] ='freya', to prevent unphysical scrapeoff of beams. [BH, 160602].
170107
======
Updating to version=cql3d_cswim_170101.1.
Reverted losscone.f to older version.  Also, urfb0.f and urfdamp1.f
reverted to older version of the rrr= resonance calculation.
Regression tests for D3D_96143_one_ray and 
D3D_ngen2_urf_NBI_H.short_rerun_161230 used to check out the code.
Also, ran a KSTAR EC test. Edc_full_eps ==> six fig agreement on current.



180425
======
Put cql3d_cswim_180101.1 under git version control.


180610:180101.2 Version Committed

190724
======
cql3d to 190724, updated as version='cql3d_git_190309.1'  
This is without the .f90 work that Garrett Wright and Yuri have done.

All 'double precision' designation have been removed, in favor of 'real*8'.
makefile_gfortran64.CentOS7.1
makefile_gfortran64_debug_BOUNDS-CHECK.CentOS7.1
employ CSPECIAL  =  -fdefault-real-8, which should henceforth be used.
Defn:  -fdefault-real-8
Set the default real type to an 8 byte wide type. Do nothing if this is
already the default. This option also affects the kind of non-double real
constants like 1.0, and does promote the default width of "DOUBLE PRECISION"
to 16 bytes if possible, unless "-fdefault-double-8" is given, too.
The -fdefault-real-8 option extends real*4 numbers to real*8 maintaining
the accuracy of the stated real*4 number, in a predictable manner, rather
than having random numbers in memory fill in the second half of the 
real*4 number without this option. Without this option, individual
runs often differ beyond the 3rd or 4th significant figure (BH).

A related option in the Intel compiler should be used.

190727
======
c[292] version="cql3d_git_190309.2" (Last pre-f90 version)
c[292] Explicitly typed REAL*4 variables which are in the arguments
c[292] of the PGPLOT plotting subroutines.  This enables compiling with
c[292] gfortran with compiler setting "-fdefault-real-8", which it is
c[292] henceforth recommended to be used. Without explicitly typing
c[292] REAL*4 literal constants used by PGPLOT, default-real-8 would
c[292] make them REAL*8 constants, and thus not work with PGPLOT subs.
c[292] There is a similar setting for the Intel compiler.
c[292] With this setting, the compiler:
c[292] Sets the default REAL type to an 8 byte wide type. Does nothing 
c[292] if this is already the default. This option also affects the 
c[292] kind of non-double real constants like 1.0, and also does promote 
c[292] the default width of "DOUBLE PRECISION" to 16 bytes if possible,
c[292] unless "-fdefault-double-8" is given, too.
c[292] However, all DOUBLE PRECISION type settings were changed to REAL*8.
c[292] [BH, 190729].



190821
======
git_cql3d_190309.3.zip git_cql3d_190309.3/ is Latest YuP with
some changes for distn of impurities over charge states.


191003
======
update3_for_cql3d_190923.0.zip  :I (YuP) included all files from update2 
(sent to you on 9/30) plus six newer files.

191014
=======
git_cql3d_190923.2 contains ad hoc pellet model and coronal equilibrium, incl. W.


201026
======
Updating cql3d to cql3d_git_200101.3.

Make copy of ./cql3d using either
mkdir cql3d_to_201026; cp -ar cql3d/.  cql3d_to_201026  # The "." includes the
      		       	      	       			  hidden files.
or
mkdir cql3d_to_201026; rsync -a cql3d/ cql3d_to_201026 

cd cql3d; git status > git_cql3d_status_201026.txt  #Gives list of present.
 ==> ~200 modified files
     ~ 50 untracked files to be added, plus 00_Cql3d_Regression_Tests/ dir.


Used git-gui  to simplify staging for commit of the many files involved:
   Can add bunch of files form the list of new and uncommitted files,
   selecting with the mouse and CTRL-Shift.  Then CTRL-T stages the selected
   files.

If stage file which are not wanted for the commit, can remove with
git reset file_or_path.
Also, git-gui:Commit:Unstage From Commit (or CTRL-U).

Commit message for git:
Version='cql3d_git_200101.3'.
Updated files with many small changes, refinements and corrections, mostly 
from YuP. Added to the Miller equilibrium specifications.  Updated gamaset 
calculation of ln(Lambda) to include an NRL table option.   
Synchrotron radiation expression checked out, and bug fixed (YuP, 200611, 
200618)  See a_change.h [Items 283-332].
Added five regression tests. See cql3d/00_Cql3d_Regression_Tests. 
This is expected to be the first of many, illustrating
the diverse capabilites of this noncircular, multi-species,
2D-in_v,1D-in-rho, implicit-time-differencing, bounce-averaged continuum
collisional-RF-quasilinear Fokker-Planck code.

 



201027
======
In git/cql3d
git remote -v
==>
origin	https://github.com/rwharvey/cql3d.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/rwharvey/cql3d.git (push)
[This could be the problem with pushing:  Why rwharvey/cql3d.git?]
But, I want to be connected to github.com/compxco. 


With great help from David Green, finally got cql3d github directory
properly set up at github.com/compxco.   A search of github for cql3d
gives that it is at:  rwharvey/cql3d, sshiraiwa/cql3d, and 
garrettwrong/cql3d_f90.

It must be that originally, for the local git/cql3d, I pulled cql3d
down from 
https://github.com/rwharvey/cql3d.git, 
after somehow getting it there.  Or, is was put there from my
git/cql3d/ directory.

Present solution was to 
(1) push the git/cql3d directory to github.com/rwharvey/cql3d
(2) move local git/cql3d/ to git/cql3d_old_rwharvey/
(3) delete the present cql3d/ from github.com/compxco,
(4) re-install it at github.com/compxco as a fork from rwharvey/cql3d,
(5) pull github.com/compxco/cql3d to my local git/ directory.

Henceforth, we will update this new installation.

Now, in git/cql3d/:
git remote -v
==> 
origin	git@github.com:compxco/cql3d.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:compxco/cql3d.git (push)

Did test after making and committing a small change in a_change.h, then 
git push -v   [-v, --verbose]  [-n, --dry-run]

Reexecuting:
git push -v -n
==> 
Pushing to git@github.com:compxco/cql3d.git
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0
To git@github.com:compxco/cql3d.git
 = [up to date]      master -> master
Everything up-to-date


201208
======
Staged and committed.
Commit message:

version="cql3d_git_201207.0"

Fixed several bugs in ADC** subroutines.

Adjusted plots related to SXR and NPA diagnostics.

Modified iprozeff="curr_fit" procedure, which changes Zeff
in such a way as to maintain the target current.
Two new namelist variables are added: zrelax (default is 0.5d0)
and zrelax_exp (default is 1.d0). The procedure is similar to 
that used in efswtch.eq."method4". See cqlinput_help for description.
