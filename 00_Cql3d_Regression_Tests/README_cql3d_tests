test1.0/test1.1   Dreicer runaway electron rates
===============
Runaway calculation, for comparison with Kulrud,Sun et al.,  PRL (1973)
Derated grids.  Careful comparison might use iy=200, jx=300, taking ~10X
longer.
test1.0 gives some time evolution of the distn.  (cpu 3.2s)
test1.1 gives final result, using very large time step.  (cpu=1.3s)

test2   Ohmic resistivity
=====

Comparison of DC toroidal electric field resistivity with
various formulas in the literature is shown the screen
dump file, log.
See
resist_phi=Resistivity, calc'd from distn
                              fnctn results
           =<E_phi/R>/<j_phi/R>, toroidal resistivity
and discussion there giving comparisons.  CQL3D calculates
the neoclassical (low collisionality) resistivity across
a full range of epsilon=rho/R=(0.,1.), and probably is
capable of greater accuracy than simi-analytic methods.
Relevant references are given the the cql3d source.

A constant Etor toroidal electric field across the
radial cross-section gives neoclassical current density and conductivity
versus radius rho, in the low-collisionality regime modeled with CQL3D.
See log_test2
If the grids and time steps are scaled up from present iy=100,jx=100,lrz=11,
nstop=2,  then cpu time scales up roughly as iy**2*jx*lrz*nstop.

test3  One ray DIII-D test case, D3D_96143_one_ray (slightly adjusted)
=====

Low power (0.5 W) for comparison with linear calculation of the ECCD.
This uses the old, text ray data input. See rayech. Self-documenting
netcdf files are generally used now (see cqlinput_help:rftype/rffile).
[Can increase the EC power using pwrscale factor, to get QL effects.
Might also need to increase enorm.]
The pltlimm=0.2 namelist variable is used so that plots versus u/vnorm
only include normalized momentum-per-mass to 0.2, to focus on the 
lower velocity region.  QL B0 diffusion coefficient, and velocity
space flux vectors are plotted for several radii.  Damping is included
due to the 2nd and 3rd harmonic interactions (nharm1=2, nharms=2).

test4  EBW test case with disk-to_disk launch or rays
=====
Test case for CD with EBW, which is propagated into MASTU
through O-X-B conversion.
The rays from genray (test10) are launched from a disk, using 
raypatt='diskdisk'.
The O-X conversion occurs at the omega=omega_pe layer.
The effect of an exponential drop-off density profile outside the LCFS 
is included using the new option istep_in_lcfs=0 in genray.in.
istep_in_lcfs=0 means: Start ray-tracing directly from {rst,zst} even
if it is far outside of the LCFS, until omega=omegape is encountered. 
That is, there no stepping along the straight-line ray characteristic 
from rst,zst until inside LCFS, as in the prior istep_in_lcfs=1 (the default) 
model. 

The ray data for this run is obtained in the companion 
git/genray/test10 test run.



test5
=====
test_multiURF_multiSpecies: A DIII-D test case.
			    Two general species: D, H. NB injection. 
                            Two FW input file, operating separately on D and H.
cqlinput_H0.short_mmsv8_adjust.4
Uses eqdsk file g122080.03100, and RF genray data from genrayfw_18rays.nc.
An extensive test with two general species of ions, H and D. This is for a 
DIIID case where primarily there was a D NB into D plasma.  Also, FW
ICRF heating.  But, a small amount of H was also present in the discharges.
The consequent heating of H and D is to be examined.
This is a shortened run from the actual study cases, so full runs would
use larger lrz,iy,jx,nstop,nplot,nplt3d.
cpu=12.6sec.
