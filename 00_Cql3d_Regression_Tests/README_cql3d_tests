test1.0/test1.1   Dreicer runaway electron rates
===============
Runaway calculation, for comparison with Kulrud,Sun et al.,  PRL (1973)
Derated grids.  Careful comparison might use iy=200, jx=300, taking ~10X
longer.
test1.0 gives some time evolution of the distn.  (cpu 3.2s)
test1.1 gives final result, using very large time step.  (cpu=1.3s)

test2   Ohmic resistivity
=====

Comparison of DC toroidal electric field resistivity with
various formulas in the literature is shown the screen
dump file, log.
See
resist_phi=Resistivity, calc'd from distn
                              fnctn results
           =<E_phi/R>/<j_phi/R>, toroidal resistivity
and discussion there giving comparisons.  CQL3D calculates
the neoclassical (low collisionality) resistivity across
a full range of epsilon=rho/R=(0.,1.), and probably is
capable of greater accuracy than simi-analytic methods.
Relevant references are given the the cql3d source.

A constant Etor toroidal electric field across the
radial cross-section gives neoclassical current density and conductivity
versus radius rho, in the low-collisionality regime modeled with CQL3D.
See log_test2
If the grids and time steps are scaled up from present iy=100,jx=100,lrz=11,
nstop=2,  then cpu time scales up roughly as iy**2*jx*lrz*nstop.

test3  One ray DIII-D test case, D3D_96143_one_ray (slightly adjusted)
=====

Low power (0.5 W) for comparison with linear calculation of the ECCD.
This uses the old, text ray data input. See rayech. Self-documenting
netcdf files are generally used now (see cqlinput_help:rftype/rffile).
[Can increase the EC power using pwrscale factor, to get QL effects.
Might also need to increase enorm.]
The pltlimm=0.2 namelist variable is used so that plots versus u/vnorm
only include normalized momentum-per-mass to 0.2, to focus on the 
lower velocity region.  QL B0 diffusion coefficient, and velocity
space flux vectors are plotted for several radii.  Damping is included
due to the 2nd and 3rd harmonic interactions (nharm1=2, nharms=2).

test4  EBW test case with disk-to_disk launch or rays
=====
Test case for CD with EBW, which is propagated into MAST-like plasma
through O-X-B conversion.
The rays from genray (test10) are launched from a disk, using 
raypatt='diskdisk'.
The O-X conversion occurs at the omega=omega_pe layer.
The effect of an exponential drop-off density profile outside the LCFS 
is included using the new option istep_in_lcfs=0 in genray.in.
istep_in_lcfs=0 means: Start ray-tracing directly from {rst,zst} even
if it is far outside of the LCFS, until omega=omegape is encountered. 
That is, there no stepping along the straight-line ray characteristic 
from rst,zst until inside LCFS, as in the prior istep_in_lcfs=1 (the default) 
model. 

The ray data for this run is obtained in the companion 
git/genray/test10 test run, which must be run first and the output genray.nc
file left in its directory.



test5
=====
test_multiURF_multiSpecies: A DIII-D test case.
			    Two general species: D, H. NB injection. 
                            Two FW input file, operating separately on D and H.
cqlinput_H0.short_mmsv8_adjust.4
Uses eqdsk file g122080.03100, and RF genray data from genrayfw_18rays.nc.
An extensive test with two general species of ions, H and D. This is for a 
DIIID case where primarily there was a D NB into D plasma.  Also, FW
ICRF heating.  But, a small amount of H was also present in the discharges.
The consequent heating of H and D is to be examined.
This is a shortened run from the actual study cases, so full runs would
use larger lrz,iy,jx,nstop,nplot,nplt3d.
cpu=12.6sec.

test6
=====
Dreicer runaway rate calc.  (cqlinput_eoved_.16_multi-flux-surface0.2.11)
The lowest r/R rate can be compared with R.M. Kulsrud et al., 
Runaway Electrons in a Plasma, Phys. Rev. Letters (1973), Fig. 1
This  test6 case  uses E/E_D=0.16, corresponding to Kulsrud's
E/E_D=0.08 in Table 1, rate=3.177e-4.  (Kulsrud used an E_D defn 
for the Dreicer electric field which is half of the usual.)
In the present test, indicates the variation of electron runaway rate 
versus inverse aspect ratio eps=r/R, giving values from eps near 
zero to near 1. .  Only four plasma minor radii are 
specified to keep  test run cpu time down (cpu=3.2 secs for 
nstop=10 time steps, giving a steady state.). 

Kulsrud is using a predecessor Fokker-Planck code provided by the
John Killeen group at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

The (derated) grid size is reduced to iy=jx=100 (theta x vel) grid, and
relativistic="disabled". Improvement in accuracy of runaway rates is
given by, for example iy=jx=300, but cpu time scales like ~iy**2*jx.

Results for this lower resolution case are:
Frame    r/R      RE rate      RE rate reduction vs eps
22       0.001   2.1989e-4     2.1989e-4/2.1989e-4=1
34	 0.25    7.4301e-5     7.4301e-5/2.1978e-4=0.3381
46       0.5 	 2.4469e-5     2.4469e-5/2.1978e-4=0.1113
58       0.9     5.5318e-7     5.5318e-7/2.1978e-4=.002517

These rate are given in frames 22, 34, 46, and 58 of the .ps o/p file,
based on the asymtotic normalized electron flux through a sphere, as a 
function of the electron velocity.

Kulsrud does not specify how the simulation achieves a steady-state density,
with electrons running off the edge of the grid. A possibility with CQL3D is
to hold the f(v=0)=constant, at the value for the initial distribution.  
This would allow build up of  density, as the runaway electron tail
becomes elevated.  There is effectively a source of electrons at v=0.
Here in this test case, rather, we add electrons with distribution equal
to the initial Maxwellian, keeping the total density on the grid
constant (lbdry(0)="conscalm").  Also, this test case uses namelist colmodl=1,
only contributions from background included in the Fokker-Planck 
collision terms, in agreement with Kulsrud et al.

The Dreicer runaway rates obtained with CQL3D are similar to, but smaller
than given by Kulsrud for his r/R=0 case (RE rate for Z=1, E=0.08 giving
RE rate 3.177e-4). The r/R in cql3d cannot be reduced exactly to zero
because of complications around the trapped-passing boundray introduced
to treat effects of toroidal trapping. This effect may be partly responsible
for the difference.

A momentum conserving collision model in CQL3D (colmodl=3), our most common
operation mode,  gives RE rate equal to 3.18e-4 for r/R=0.001, much closer 
to the Kulrsud rate.
